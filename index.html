        <h2>Crazy Kompetition for Infants</h2>
        <p>
          Crazy Kompetition for Infants (CKI) is an annual event that raises money for Pediatric Trauma Program (PTP) through a series of fun, competitive mini-games and relays. As the first District event of the academic year, Crazy Komp allows new members their first chance to meet so many different people while giving returning members an opportunity to reconnect with old friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Form teams within your home club or division and compete against other teams to be the last one standing! Crazy Komp will let you tap into your inner child and release your competitive spirit! Ask your club president about registering to find out if you have what it takes to come out on top!

        <h2>Pediatric Trauma Program</h2>
        <p>
          The Pediatric Trauma Program is a charity established by the Kiwanis Cal-Nev-Ha Foundation in 1994 which focuses on the need for education and training in pediatric trauma and injury prevention. The purpose of the program is to develop local service projects to educate people of childrenâ€™s safety to decrease the number of children who are severely injured or killed due to traumatic unintentional injuries. Funds raised are used to purchase safety equipment, provide proper training to medical staff, and support projects created by our six partner hospitals.

                  Yes! This also applies to incomplete teams that do not have six members. Simply list the members that lack a team (or incomplete teams) in one of the team registrations and submit their waivers and registration fees. The Finance and Fundraising Committee will then combine all incomplete teams and individual players onsite to maximize the number of people participating.

          <h2>Do members need to be dues-paid to attend?</h2>
          <span>
            No. All attendees must either be (1) dues-paid members of Kiwanis or Circle K; (2) </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">prospective Circle K-ers</span><span> who are currently enrolled at an institution where a chartered or chartering club is located; or (3) given explicit permission from District Administrator Mondo Velazquez to attend.
          </span>
          <br><br>
          <h2>Who needs to sign a waiver?</h2>
          <p>
            ALL interested members MUST sign a waiver. This includes participants, judges, spectators, and on-site medics. Early Registration participants should mail in waivers along with the Early Registration document and check though you are allowed to submit waivers on-site as well.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>How many people are in a team? How many males and females?</h2>
          <p>
            There is a maximum of six members per team with the option of one alternate player. There is no specific gender ratio.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>How many teams can my club register?</h2>
          <p>
            Your club may register as many teams as they wish! Simply copy and paste more tables in the Registration Word Doc to register more teams.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>Can clubs register with incomplete teams?</h2>
          <p>
            We recommend reaching out to your home club and division (eg. by posting on FB pages or asking around during general meetings or DCMs) if you are struggling to find a complete team. However, incomplete teams are still welcome -- we will combine incomplete teams on-site!
          </p>
          <br>
